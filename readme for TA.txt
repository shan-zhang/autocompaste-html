I have edited README.md to include new information about the new IV, "Number of windows opened". 
It also has information on how I generate experiments.json.

You may find my changes by looking at commits in the github repository:
https://github.com/mushopea/autocompaste-html

You can access the application here:
http://autocompaste.herokuapp.com
Although I do recommend rendering it locally as the application takes time to load remotely.

Thanks :)
